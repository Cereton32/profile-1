    <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
    <h4 class="hover-text">As Interior Designer</h4>
    <p>In addition to my professional experience, I also thrive in the world of freelancing.
        Working as a freelancer allows me to explore my creativity further and collaborate closely with clients to bring their visions to life. 
        Whether it's a small apartment renovation or a larger-scale commercial project,
         I enjoy the flexibility and the opportunity to work directly with clients to understand their needs and preferences.
         As a freelancer, I offer services including:

Interior Design Consultation: Providing expert advice on space planning, color schemes, furniture selection, and decor to clients seeking to enhance their interiors.
Concept Development: Creating mood boards, sketches, and 3D renderings to visualize design concepts and ensure client satisfaction before implementation.
Project Management: Overseeing all aspects of the design process, from initial concept to final installation, to ensure projects are completed on time and within budget.
